The Project Files folder, contains the below folders

The datasets we have used for analysis is in the Datasets folder.
The source code of our project website is in the Web Interface Implementation folder along with flask deployment code and websites assets.
The tableau workbooks in packaged form are in Workbooks folder along with the Dashboard Background Images folder which contains the background images we used for dashboards.

The demo video of our project couldn't be uploaded here due to size constraints so we are pasting the google drive link for it below,

In the Project Report.pdf, Appendix section has the google drive links to the following

Project demo video.
A folder containing the video demonstration of each project step we carried out.
A folder containing all files related to web interface implementation.

The Performance Testing step of the project isn't covered in separate video demonstration, rather in the video demonstration of visualisations we have demonstrated the process of creating the filters required for the visualisations. And with respect to calculated fields, we haven't created any because our dataset gave the information directly without the need to make a separate calculated field, also as our project dataset consisted more of text and ID fields and less of numerical fields, we didn't require calculated fields.

We created a total of 16 unique visualisations, 3 filters- Season, Characters and Locations, 4 dashboards and 1 story. We used MySQL to connect our datasets with tableau. The packaged workbook might ask for password, but if the connection is given appropriately to the datasets we have uploaded, all our individual visualisations, dashboards and stories will be visible. But to present our datasets to you without need of connecting to datasets, we are attaching the links to dashboards and story below.
